      The goal of the game is to conquer the entire map.
      Each territory has a number of armies. To attack you have to select your territory with at least 2 armies and then choose enemy territory.
      Who roll larger total number wins.
      In case of a tie, attacker looses.
      You can attack multiple times per turn.
      At the end of the turn, the player receives a number of armies according to number of territories and successful attacks.
      Armies are added randomly.
      To pass the move to the next player, click ">>" button.
